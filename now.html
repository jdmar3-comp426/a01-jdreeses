    <h1>Where Are They Now?</h1>
    <p>As often is the case with folk tradition, the existence of an 
        entity is directly tied to the perception of it in the public's mind.
        Since the release of <em>Among Us</em> in 2018, popularity of the video 
        game has subsided somewhat, and in turn, so have reports of the 
        mysterious Imposter. Police Reports indicate that a person or creature
        resembling The Imposter has never been caught, so the question remains... 
        if The Imposter truly was and is real, is he still out there somewhere... 
        Among Us?
