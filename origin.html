    <p>The Imposter is the designated name of the traitor, or enemy, in
        the hit game <em>Among Us.</em> The goal of The Imposter in 
        the game is sto stealthily kill every other player. 
        From the initial release, people were disturbed and frightened 
        by The Imposter's monstrous appearance and gruesome actions upon 
        killing another player character. Naturally, art and creative depictions
        of this act soon began to surface on the internet.

    <p>As often is the case with folktales, soon the line became blurred
        between what is fact and what is fiction in regards to The Imposter.
        Appearances of The Imposter were reported outside of the scope of 
        the game and into <em>real life.</em>
